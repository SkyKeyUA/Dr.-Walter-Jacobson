							<div class="forgive__text forgive__text--grow">
								<p>Most of us don't get what we want in our lives because we sabotage
									ourselves: We procrastinate. We resist. We don't follow through. We
									don't do the things that we know are in our best interests. The end
									result is a life of unfulfillment and disappointment. It doesn't have to be
									that way.</p>
								<p>
									When we eliminate the guilt, shame, and self-loathing deeply embedded
									in our unconscious mind which generate our self-destructive,
									self-defeating behaviors, our world changes for the better: We start
									attracting people and circumstances that cooperate with our goals and
									propel us towards the manifestation of all our hopes and dreams.

									<p>“I have done healing work for years and picked up Forgive to Win! for a family
										member, but when I reviewed the book, I found myself healing past wounds I
										didn't know existed. What I found is that this book holds the key to unlimited
										success and an abundant life. I highly recommend it.” ~ Ken D. Foster,
										Founder Premier Coaching</p>

								<div class="testamonials__text">
									<p>“Forgive to Win! is a powerful book that will transform you and those around
										you. I encourage you to buy several copies and then give them away. You will
										be empowered as you do. Thanks to Dr. Jacobson for giving the world the
										cure for self-sabotage and the key to attracting lasting success.” ~ Ron
										Stebelton, Eagle Leadership Consulting</p>

							<li class="testamonials__item">
								<div class="testamonials__text">
									<p>“Forgive To Win! is a book of self-help and self-discovery reminiscent of best-
										selling books like The Secret and The Power of Now. While those books are
										excellent, Forgive To Win! takes self-help to a whole new level by showing
										individuals just how to apply its principles into their daily lives for amazing
										results!”~ Mihir Shah</p>

							<li class="testamonials__item">
								<div class="testamonials__text">
									<p>“Dr. Jacobson has written a concise, common sense book, “Forgive To Win!,
										that will be of practical use to anyone who is interested in achieving
										happiness, well-being and material success. It covers a huge subject, adopting
										a very sage approach that is different from the usual cheerleading method
										often prevalent in books of a similar nature.” ~ Norman Goldman</p>
